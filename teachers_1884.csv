Being a student of French, Serbian, Portuguese, and Russian, I understand the need to practice with native speakers in order to maintain and improve your language skills. In my experience, the best thing for you to do is SPEAK.

I find that speaking as much as you possibly can is, without a doubt, the best way to learn how to comfortably express yourself.

I can suggest grammar exercises to reinforce your English, too. You can also watch videos or read articles and summarize them for me, which I can correct for you. (This is helpful for a native-like style and diction!)","For our first lesson, I like to break it down into 3 steps: 

1. Intro

2. Objective(s)
This helps me tailor a learning experience specifically to your needs. (For school, for conversational purposes, for pronunciation purposes, for studying abroad, et cetera.)

As far as the homework goes, spaced repetition is the most effective way to learn and keep the knowledge in your long-term memory (proven by science), so there will be exercises that specifically train your brain so that what we learn in class, you do not forget over time.",,40 Reviews

I've earned credits from the University of Los Angeles in early child education and development, so I am very comfortable working with younger students. I have also given English lessons during my time in France, working with native French speakers in a conversational setting to help the pupils develop recognition and improve pronunciation as well as developing technical language skills for their workplace or university.","My lessons are based around the interests and needs of the students. For example, working with a business student recently, I sectioned off parts of her assigned text which we were able to review in detail and I supplemented the lessons with articles found online relating to American and global businesses. I create slideshows and presentations for the pupils as well so that in between lessons/sessions, they can have something concrete and familiar to return to. Additionally, I find that conversation and listening activities are crucial to the language learning process, and this has been something which helped enormously when I first began learning French.",,129 Reviews

I also take notes during our lessons so I can keep track of what we’ve already worked on and plan what to work on next. ️️📓","😀 My classes are fun and encouraging. My goal is to give you confidence and help you improve as quickly as possible! 💯

My teaching strategy is based on the ""Comprehensible Input method"" by Stephen Krashen. This method is based on research that shows students learn languages by listening and reading messages that they understand--NOT by studying lists of vocabulary and memorizing grammar rules. The fastest way to learn English is also the most fun--listening and reading for pleasure.

☆  English is a non-tonal language. Thus, it sounds very different from tone languages such as Mandarin Chinese or Cantonese. In tone languages, pitch (the degree of highness or lowness of a tone) is used to distinguish word meaning. So a word said with high pitch may have a different meaning than the same word said with a low pitch.
☆ In English, much information is carried by the use of auxiliaries and by verb inflections: is/are/were, eat/eats/ate/eaten, etc. Chinese, on the other hand, is an uninflected language and conveys meaning through word order, adverbials or shared understanding of the context.","☆ My teaching style focuses on the individual student and assesses their ability.All my classes are tailored to your level.
☆ Our first lesson will be to find your specific level, and then from there I will provide materials and classes specific to your level.
☆ I will focus on building your vocabulary, practising sentence structure and grammar as a way of communication, and also using this in a performance-based activity. 
☆The material I provide is used at universities around the world for learners of Chinese and Cantonese,

I also encourage my learners to voice out and share their ideas, and thoughts in order to be heard and develop their confidence and self-esteem since it is two way of learning process.","As I plan my lessons ahead of time, I anticipate that my learners will enjoy, appreciate, and have a great time performing every task assigned. I give varied teaching activities based on their level of understanding like film viewing, PowerPoint presentations, reading out loud, free talk, and others. 

I also ensure that my learners will learn a lot during our session and apply what they will adapt in real-life situations while having a great time learning.

Indeed, lessons provided to the learners are on spiral progression that they can easily understand the topics well. There are lots of things to consider in learning. It needs to plan carefully and engage themselves throughout the lesson.",,78 Reviews

I'm Ilaria or just Ila for short. I'm a bilingual English/Italian CELTA-qualified English teacher, who has been working in education both abroad and in the UK for over 7 years. 

I was born in Italy but moved to the UK at age 6 and have lived and worked in both countries. Coming from a multicultural background led me to study Linguistics and Cultural Mediation at the University of Milan. There, I developed my passion for languages, studying some French, Spanish and Japanese during my course.

For example, I offer:

-General English lessons
-Business English lessons
-Exam preparation for Cambridge KET, PET, FIRST, ADVANCED & PROFICIENCY as well as for IELTS
-Job & University interview practice
-Proofreading & corrections
-Essay writing & homework help

I believe that learning should be both stimulating /and/ fun, and I always strive to make my lessons dynamic and engaging.

I am confident I can help you with your language learning needs, so feel free to send me a message!","I've never stopped being a language student myself, so this helps me keep in mind my own students' perspective and pushes me to find better and better ways to teach.

For me, language learning happens best in context, via engaging materials and natural conversation. The main focus of my lessons will usually be speaking and listening, as these are the skills you can't study alone, yet are vital to transferring your passive knowledge of a language into active knowledge. I use a combination of my own lesson plans, authentic articles, videos, photos and audio taken from the web and some textbooks- particularly for exam practice- alternating between them to help you develop all your skills.","2017 - 2020

I’m Jack, and I’m a native English speaker. I’m from the UK, but I’ve lived in Italy and Germany over the last few years. I love to travel, and I'm always ready to learn about other people’s cultures. I love to learn foreign languages myself, and I have reached quite a good level in French, Italian and German, so I can really understand the struggles of language learners.

I have worked as an English teacher for three years, and as an English teaching assistant before that.

My lesson style is quite relaxed, to help you to improve your confidence. I get my students to speak as much as possible, in order to practise and receive feedback.","I am very flexible with my teaching. I think students learn the best when they get the chance to talk about something they enjoy. I will be happy to plan lessons for topics that interest you. I am also happy to focus on a particular skill or objective, like passing an exam.

After assessing your level of English, I will help you to improve by correcting mistakes and by widening your vocabulary and grammar. I focus heavily on speaking, because this is often the most difficult area for my students, and because it is the hardest thing to study without a teacher. 

If you book me for an exam class, I will help you with exam strategy for Cambridge or for IELTS.

Rather than asserting outright what is right or wrong, I like to encourage students to work things out for themselves, what mistakes they have made and why have they made them. In this way, rather than language learning being an exercise in memorisation, students really come to internalise the language and feel it for themselves.","I vary the style and content of my lessons a lot to match different student's language learning goals and learning styles. Some of my students engage mostly in self study, and want to use their time with a teacher to work on specific aspects of English that want help with. On the other hand, some students want me to guide them through a curriculum, to set out a guideline of what to learn and when. During lessons, I often diagnose weaknesses in a student's English that they might not see themselves.

The assignments had me formulating custom lesson plans based on a hypothetical class structure and a specific point of interest such as a grammar point, vocab list, or one of the four skills: reading, writing, listening and speaking. We went through the tried and true best practices for teaching and I learned how to enable my students to get the most out of their lessons.

👁 Writing has always been one of my passions because the ability to express oneself through words has such an impact on the reality that one creates. During my college years, I shared my passion for writing with many others.  I was chosen to be a teacher’s assistant for ESL classes, and I worked alongside English professors to edit and revise student essays for all 4 years.  I recently obtained a TEFOL and have received several offers to teach at International Schools around the planet.  

Teaching for me is way of sharing and inspiring others, it is a great hobby of mine :)","“One looks back with appreciation to brilliant teaches, but with gratitude to those who touched our human feelings.” 
   - CARL JUNG

👁 This quote takes on incredible value and meaning when I hear a student struggling (not always with language) come out of a lesson feeling stimulated and positive. In order to actively learn a language, there is talking and listening; therefore, I believe each lesson should be filled with meaningful conversation. When I listen to my students, I find that we share many things in common from the pleasures and joys of life to the pains and sorrows that are inevitable for our growth.

I taught for 10 years.  Though this seems quite different from teaching a language, it was, in fact, excellent preparation for my career as an English teacher.  Learning correct pronunciation involves learning unfamiliar movements.  It is much more a physical skill than an academic exercise.  To achieve fluency in speaking, one cannot carefully think about each word or phrase --- words and phrases must be automatic.  To learn to speak automatically, one must practice regularly and diligently.  I prefer to correct a student's mistakes immediately so that s/he is more likely to remember the correct usage.","In my experience, many students were never taught the basic sounds of English.  For this reason, I always include phonics exercises as part of every class.  When teaching grammar, I focus on the meaning of a particular construction rather than just how to make it.  It is important for students to do exercises that require them to choose between more than one possible grammatical construction.  This replicates real life, where one must choose the construction that will communicate the correct meaning.","Teaching English as a Foreign Language University of Toronto, OISE 2020

I have four-year experience in language teaching, Chinese Mandarin, ESOL, and IELTS. Compared with teaching in classrooms I prefer to teach in a casual way that allows learners to use the target language with ease. Experiential learning can be an efficient method. Practise within contexts is the key to master a language. Talking with a language companion with the knowledge in both English and Mandarin can build up your confidence and skills gradually and naturally.","In conversational practise, there can be different topics emerging for each learner. For beginners, I may use pictures to illustrate things, e.g. to show a right tongue position of a sound in Mandarin. For medium-senior learners, I use Mandarin as much as they can accept to make conversations.
I like being creative in tutoring. In the past several years, I gradually learn how to lead learners to achieve their goals with suitable strategies, considering to their personalities and needs.

English","['French', 'Japanese']","大家好！ I'm Jennifer, a native Chinese speaker from mainland China, currently living in Dongguan, which is known as the 'world factory'. 

I worked as an language teacher for a couple of years and then worked as a translator in an international company. Both of this experience showed me how to learn a new language the most efficient way.

I have a strong passion both for learning and teaching language. I benefit a lot from knowing English, which is my second language. I get to know western culture from communicating with English speakers and reading English books. It is quite different from Chinese culture and the learning process is very interesting.","italki teacher since May 22, 2021",Super Welcoming for Chinese Beginners 😊,From China,"Living in Dongguan, China (22:36 UTC+08:00)",5.0,63,686,100%,100%,USD 7.99,"Over the past years, I've taught Chinese and English to thousands of students. 

Teaching Chinese to an American CEO was my most memorable teaching experiences. He was a beginner to Chinese when we started, but now he can communicate effectively with Chinese companies without needing a translator.

I also taught English to middle school students. They were very engaged and excited in my class because they always paid a lot attention to either win a game or complete a task.

I really enjoy teaching because I can see my students improvements with my help. As a languege learner myself, I believe that having fun in the learning process is very important to keep the motivation up and up.","Your lessons are customized just for you! You'll learn systematically with clear plans, practice exercises and review materials.

I always like to pay attention to polish your pronunciation in the beginning. Once you get the pronounciation right, you'll be more confident to speak and use the language.

Our lessons will always be interactive！You will expand your vocabulary quickly and get better understanding of grammar/sentence structure through lots of conversational practice. If I can ONLY use one word to describe my lessons, it would be CONVERSATIONAL.

-Writing Task 2
-Speaking Part (1-3)

As for specifics, when it comes to the lessons themselves, I primarily work through teaching within conversation where myself and my student will engage in topics of interest where I encourage my student to speak whilst I calmly correct of their speech. In addition to that I find it effective to engage in writing exercises between classes but this homework is optional. Other than that I take requests from my students and ensure that they learn in whatever way may best suit them.","In my lessons I like to teach in a calm, fun and relaxed manner primarily through conversational exercises. Throughout the conversation I will correct on grammar, pronunciation and logical errors. Through this method I hope to improve upon my students' listening, speaking, and comprehension skills while also working primarily on their confidence with their English speaking. Aside from conversations during lessons I like to also adapt my lessons based on my students needs and do other exercises as need by or if my students request them. I also tend to give out writing exercises for between classes that will then also add to the next class's agenda.","2020 - 2021

I've also taught business English to corporate clients and helped students prepare for tests, job interviews, and visa interviews.","The most effective lessons tend to focus on texts and/or pictures about one of the student's personal interests. The text should be somewhat challenging, but ideally not below 90% comprehensibility. I have the student read the text aloud or describe the picture, then I ask questions about it. I define any unknown words and phrases either with images or an explanation in English. I'll then lead a discussion on the topic in which I try to draw out the student's own opinions and experiences.

Although I prefer to teach in a communicative manner, my education gives me a strong foundation in grammar, so I can answer any questions a student might have on that topic.","2013 - 2015

要找到一位好的英语老师不难。但大多数母语为中文的英语教师，都是通过学习而掌握英语。要达到交流顺畅和口语自然，不是靠背单词，记语法和做习题；文化特征，语境，风俗习惯等等，是不可或缺的内容。

在国外20+年的生活，留学，和工作经验（华尔街实习，企业工作7+年）让我在课上能够穿插讲解相关的文化背景知识。我学过韩语和日语，所以理解学习语言的艰辛。还记得刚到新加坡的时候，一句英文也听不懂，没办法和其他小朋友玩耍，老师上课时更是糊涂和迷茫。后来随着时间，英语能力自然而然地和当地孩子没区别了。

所谓语言学习技巧啦成功学啦，各种教学窍门五花八门不胜枚举。撇开好不好有没有效果不说 ，至少不是每位老师的教学方法都适合每个人。学习语言最基本的就是多练习，加上出错的时候能即使被纠正，不要一直浸泡在错误中。 细节的部分就因人而异，根据自己的程度，目标，时间，兴趣等等，找到最适合有效的学习方式。让我用标准的普通话，带你“学习”标准的英文吧！

I help you achieve conversational fluency, sound natural, understand cultural nuances, and be comfortable using English, versus simply studying the language.","我提供三类课程：口语，商务英语，和情景类模拟。情景类模拟包括：美国各项签证的面试题模拟练习（可包括F1学生签证，H1B工作签证，和绿卡的答疑）；模拟练习其他国家签证的面试题；为美国/国外留学而准备申请材料；到美国或新加坡旅游的准备工作和练习求职面试题等。

我从16岁开始教课，虽不曾是全职教师，但累积私教经验也有数年，教过各个年龄层的学生 - 学前儿童，小学生，初中生，大学生和工作的成年人。我擅长根据个人情况，比如说语言掌握程度，学习能力，预期目标，习惯的学习方式，兴趣爱好等等，来拟定一个专属计划。用英文，用中文，或两者兼有的方式授课皆可。

发音是让他人理解自己的基础 - 我会一个字一个字地纠正。每上一节课我都可以录制专属于你的音频，让你能够更加方便有效地复习上课内容。

我会提供教材，但不建议使用课本 - 有特殊需求的话可以讨论。
